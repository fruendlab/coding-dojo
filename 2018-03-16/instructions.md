- Write a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer as argument and prints
  each number from 1 to that integer on a separate line **except**

  - If a number is divisible by 3, write fizz instead of the number
  - If a number is divisible by 5, write buzz instead of the number
  - If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, write fizzbuzz instead of the number

- Constraints (choose one):
  - Lazy Programmer: Determine one person to only write tests and one person to only write "production" code.
    1. The tester writes a test that fails
    2. The programmer writes as little as possible to make the test pass
    3. No talking (also no implicit talking as in code comments, ...)
  - Baby steps:
    1. Set a timer for 2 Minutes
    2. write a test that fails
    3. write code that makes the test pass
    4. Commit
    5. Start a 1. again.
    If the timer rings before you commit, you have to reset (git reset --hard)
    and start again.

- Additional challenges (optional):
  - No functions longer than a single line
  - No `if` statements
  - No loops
